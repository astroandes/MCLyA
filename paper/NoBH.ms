From the optical spectrum Tol 1214-277 looks like a star forming galaxy in the
BPT diagram rather than an AGN (put reference). 
From obs with Chandra X-ray (Thuan 2015) the data don't seem to have
any sign of a SMBH.

The question now is how can we reconcile such a high mass derived from a
the Lya line without a SMBH? 

What is the explantion for the emission in NeV without X-ray binaries?
