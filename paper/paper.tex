\begin{abstract}
  The conditions in star-forming Compact Dwarf Galaxies (CDGs) 
  place them as the best systems to test models on primordial
galaxy formation and evolution.    
Here we report on one of such CDGs, \tol, which presents
a broad, single peaked, highly symmetric \lya\ line emission that had
evaded theoretical interpretation so far.  
In this paper we explain these features by two different physically
motivated kinematic models: 
an interstellar medium composed by outflowing clumps with 
random motions and an homogeneous gaseous sphere undergoing solid body
rotation.
It is the first time that an observed \lya\ spectrum can be explained
assuming either of these kinematic conditions.
The multiphase model requires a clump velocity dispersion of
at least \sigmaclump\ with outflows of \inftyclump\ at most, while the
bulk rotation velocity is constrained to be $348^{+75}_{-48}$ \kms.
This shows the importance of considering multiphase
and rotation kinematics among the possible conditions shaping the
\lya\ spectra.
However, we consider that the multiphase model has more chances to
agree with \tol's reality. 
The clump velocity dispersion implies a dynamical mass of at least $2\times
10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, ten times its baryonic mass, which can be
explained if \tol\ is hosted by a dark matter halo of at least
$10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$; conditions similar to those of dwarf elliptical
galaxies. 
If future kinematic maps of \tol\ confirm the velocities found by the
multiphase model, it could provide a new perspective to study
evolutionary processes linking star-forming with quiescent phases in
primordial galaxy evolution.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Primordial galaxies have not been detected yet. 
However, dwarf star forming galaxies with a low metallicity content
are seen as templates to understand the early galaxy evolution process. 
Over fifty years ago it was realized that young galaxies could be
detected through a strong \lya\ line emission \citep{PartridgePeebles}.    

This theoretical prediction was only confirmed thirty years later on
distant, relatively young, not primordial, galaxies \citep{1998ApJ...498L..93D}.
Currently Lyman Alpha Emitting (LAE) galaxies are commonly targeted
in surveys. 
The presence of the \lya\ emission line provides confirmation of
the distance to a galaxy while provides clues about the stellar
population and inter-stellar medium conditions regulating the
\lya\ emission.
A careful clustering analysis of LAEs can also yield clues about their link
to dark matter halos
\citep{2004AJ....128.2073H,2007ApJ...671..278G,2007ApJ...668...15K,2008MNRAS.391.1589O,2010MNRAS.409..184P,2013MNRAS.431.1777G,2016ApJ...828....5M}. 

The \lya\ emission line is not exclusive of distant galaxies. 
There are local Universe surveys that target \lya\ emission in nearby
dwarf star forming galaxies.
The study of nearby LAE samples has allowed the study of other
indicators that might be more difficult to obtain for distant galaxies
such as galaxy morphology, dust attenuation, neutral hydrogen contents and
ionization state. See \cite{Hayes15} and references therein for a review.

However, the physical interpretation of \lya\ observations is
not straightforward \citep{LARS,2015ApJ...805...14R}. 
This is due to the resonant nature of the \lya\ line. 
A \lya\ photon follows a diffusion-like process before escaping
the galaxy or being absorbed by dust. 
The resulting line profile becomes sensitive to the dynamical, chemical
and thermal conditions in the interstellar medium. 
There are few analytical tools available to interpret the
emerging \lya\ line
\citep{Harrington73,1991ApJ...370L..85N,LoebRybicki,2006ApJ...645..792T}. 
They are applicable only in cases of highly symmetrical
conditions of the gaseous hydrogen distribution in the galaxy model,
which are hardly met in real astrophysical systems. 
For these reasons the interpretation of \lya\ observations
requires state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations.   

Observed \lya\ line profiles usually present a single peak shifted
redwards from the line's center. 
Sometimes a double peak is present but the asymmetry persists with 
the peak on the red side being stronger. 
This can be explained as a result of an outflowing shell of neutral Hydrogen.
\citep{2006A&A...460..397V,Orsi12,2012ApJ...751...29Y,2015ApJ...812..123G}.

\tol\ is a compact star forming dwarf galaxy that presents a
strong \lya\ emission with puzzling 
features: the line is highly symmetric, single peaked and broad around the
line's center \citep{Thuan97}.
This kind of profile also raises the question whether some high
redshift LAEs have asymmetric lines because the blue half was
truncated by the intergalactic medium \citep{2007MNRAS.377.1175D}. 
In this case the \lya\ radiation could emerge as a low surface
brightness glow, which may be connected to \lya\ halos, while also
influencing the way LAEs can be used as a probe of reionization
See the review by \cite{2014PASA...31...40D} and the references therein.

Attempts to explain the atypical \lya\ features in \tol\ with
conventional models based on a expanding shell have not been succesful
so far \citep{mashesse03,2015A&A...578A...7V}. 
This justifies a new study using two new physically motivated
situations: a multiphase outflowing interstellar medium and bulk rotation for a
galaxy without outflows.

The main motivation for the outflowing multiphase model (as presented
in \cite{Gronke2016}) is that some dwarf galaxies are expected to
present outflows.  
Observationally, outflows have been detected in few local dwarf galaxies
\citep{1998ApJ...506..222M,2005MNRAS.358.1453O}. 
Clumpy multiphase outflows are capable to explain \lya\ features around
star-forming galaxies
\citep{2010ApJ...717..289S,2012MNRAS.424.1672D}. 


The motivation for the rotation without outflows (as presented in
\cite{GaravitoCamargo2014}) is that dwarf galaxies show coherent
rotation features  \citep{2009A&A...493..871S} and it is expected that
some of them have high neutral gas contents with long quiescent phases
without high gas outflows triggered by supernova activity
\citep{2005A&A...433L...1B,2008ApJ...672..888T,2013MNRAS.434.2491G}.   



The models we use correspond to simplified geometrical configurations.
This allows us to perform a deep exploration of parameter space and
gain some physical insight into \tol's kinematic properties.
In this paper we show, for the first time in the literature, that \tol's
\lya\ profile can be explicitly modeled be either of these two
models. 

We do not claim that our findings discard the existence of different
undiscovered models that could reproduce the observed features in \tol.
More involved models with multiple kinematic components could
in principple be also sucessful.
We focus on presenting two simple and succesful models that
manage, for the first time, to account for \tol's \lya\ line main
features. 

We review first the observational characteristics of
\tol, then we summarize the main features in the multiphase and
rotation models to explain how we fit their free parameters 
to the \tol's \lya\ line shape.
We use the results to interpret them in terms of the galaxy's
dynamical mass and explain why the multiphase model should be prefered
over the rotation model.
We close by discussing the physical scenarios opened up by our
results and the additional observational information needed to clarify
the kinematic nature of \tol.

rotation and multiphase model, respectively. 
These two different models are able to reproduce the main morphological
features of \tol's \lya\ line emission.\label{fig:results}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\tol's basic observational characteristics are summarized in Table \ref{obstable}.
Its receding velocity is $7785\pm 50$km s$^{-1}$ translates
into a distance of $106.6$ Mpc, using a Hubble constant value of $H_{0}$=73
km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

Archival Chandra X-ray data \footnote{\url{http://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/}} does not show any
detection for \tol. 
This lack of detection motivates our assumption that \lya\ emission is
powered by star formation only.



The observed flux for the \lya\ line is $\sim
8.1\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ \citep{Thuan97}.
The \lya\ Equivalent Width is $70$\AA\ and its H$\beta$ flux is 
$1.62\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ \AA${-1}$
which gives a \lya/H$\beta$ flux ratio of
4.9$\pm$0.1 \citep{Izotov04}.
The \lya\ flux values correspond to a luminosity of
$L_{Ly\alpha}=2.2\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which in turn
translates  into a lower bound for the star formation rate of $2.0$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ after using a standard conversion factor between
luminosity and star formation rate of $9.1\times 10^{-43}$
$L_{Ly\alpha}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ 
without any
correction by extinction
\citep{Kennicutt98}.
Comparing the \lya/H$\beta$ ratio with the theoretical
expectation from case B recombination of $23.3$ \citep{Hummer1987} one
can estimate an escape fraction of $20$\% for \lya\ radiation.

The bolometric UV luminosity is $9.43\pm1.94 \times 10^{8}$
L$_{\odot}$ as measured by GALEX. Without any correction by extinction
and following the empirical relation by \cite{Kennicutt98}, this
corresponds to a star formation rate of $0.35\pm 0.05$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$. 
The absolute magnitude in the $V$ band translates into a luminosity of
$8.9\times 10^{8}$ L$_{\odot}$.  
Its metallicity is $\sim Z_{\odot}/24$ as derived from
optical spectroscopy \citep{Izotov04}.

The near-infrared fluxes at $3.6$ $\mu$m and $4.5$ $\mu$m are
$7.71\pm0.55\times 10^{-5}$ Jy and $7.98\pm0.71\times 10^{-5}$ Jy
\citep{2008ApJ...678..804E}.
Using the conversion between fluxes and
stellar mass, $M_{\star} =
10^{5.65} \times F_{3.6}^{2.85} \times F_{4.5}^{-1.85} \times
(D/0.05)^2 M_{\odot}$,  calibrated on the Large Magellanic Cloud 
and  where fluxes are in Jy and $D$ is the luminosity
distance to the source in Mpc, we find $M_{\star} = 1.45\pm0.45\times 10^{8}
M_{\odot}$, with a $30\%$ uncertainty coming from the calibration
process \citep{2012AJ....143..139E}.  

We computed the projected half-light radius to be $R_s=1.5\pm0.1$ kpc 
from the surface brightness profiles reported by \cite{2003A&A...410..481N}. 
Assuming spherical geometry, one can translate this value into a 3D
half-light radius of $r_s=3R_s/2=2.25$ kpc.
Imaging observations by \cite{2001AJ....121..169F} show that \tol\ is
an isolated field galaxy not belonging to a group or cluster. 

There is an upper limit for the  $21$ cm line integrated flux of $<0.10$
Jy km s$^{-1}$  which translates into a upper limit for the HI mass of
$M<2.65\times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ \citep{pustilnikmartin07}.

\section{Theoretical Models and Parameter Estimation}


\subsection{Multiphase ISM} 

The idealized multiphase model consists of spherical, cold, dense
clumps of neutral hydrogen (and dust) embedded in a hot, ionized
medium \citep{Gronke2016}. 
The clumps also have a random and an outflowing velocity
component which totals the number of parameters describing the model
to be $14$, which also include information about the spatial
distribution and thermal state of the clumps and the intraclump
medium. 
We do not explore inflowing clumps given the slight line asymmetry
redwards to the line center (see the dots in Figure \ref{fig:results})

In order to map out this large parameter space, we randomly drew
$2500$ sets of parameters within a observationally realistic range,
based on the considerations of \citet{Laursen2013ApJ...766..124L}, 
yielding a large variety of single-, double- and triple-peaked
spectra. 
The full analysis of the the spectral features as well as
more details on the radiative transfer are presented by
\citet{Gronke2016}.    

We compare each resulting spectra to the observational results from
\tol\ after normalizing the observed and simulated spectra to have a 
flux integral of one.
We build a $\chi^2$ on the normalized flux measurements for each one
of the $2500$ models

\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i} \frac{({f}_i - \hat{f}_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2}, 
\label{eq:chi2}
\end{equation}
%
where $i$ iterates over velocity bins, $f_{i}$ is the observed flux,
$\sigma_i$ is the observed flux uncertainty and $\hat{f}_i$ is the
model estimated flux.
We do not have analytic expression for $\hat{f}$, instead we use the
results of the MonteCarlo to build histograms that play the role of
$\hat{f}$.   

We select for further analysis the best $1\%$ models according to the
lowest $\chi^2$ values.
We note that the difference between the lowest and highest $\chi^2$ values in
those $25$ models is close to $\Delta\chi^2 = 3000$, the lowest
$\chi^2$ being close to $\chi^2_{min}=1200$. 
The total number of degrees of freedom, $d.o.f$, is $104$. 

We divide the results in two classes: low $\chi^2/d.o.f.<35$ and high
$\chi^2/d.o.f.35>$.
We apply a random forest classification algorithm to find the
more relevant parameters in splitting the results into these two
classes. 
The algorithm uses $500$ trees for the classification and a
maximum of $3$ depth levels. 
To check for tability we repeat the computation $10$ times by
randomly subsampling the input data to use $80\%$ of the data as a
training set.

We also perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to compare each parameter
distribution in the best $25$ models against the parent distribution
of $2500$ models. 
If we obtain a p-value $<0.05$ for a given model parameter, we conclude that
this parameter does influence the $\chi^2$ result, as the distribution for
the best $\chi^2$ models is statistically different to the
distribution from the global sample of $2500$ models.  

We finally compute the best values for the influential parameters as
the values that produce the minimum $\chi^2$.  
We estimate the 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty from a parabolic fit to the
$\chi^2$ as a function of the influential parameters around its
corresponding minimum.   




\subsection{Bulk Rotation}

The rotation model corresponds to the work presented in
\citep{GaravitoCamargo2014} based on the Monte Carlo code
\texttt{CLARA} \citep{CLARA}. 
In that model the \lya\ photons are propagated 
within a spherical and homogeneous cloud of HI gas undergoing solid
body rotation.
The sphere is fully characterized by three parameters: the HI line's
center optical  depth $\tau$ measured from the center to its surface, the HI
temperature $T$, and the linear surface velocity $V_{\rm max}$.  
The observed line profile also depends on $\theta$,  the angle between the plane
perpendicular to the rotation axis and the observational
line-of-sight.  
In this model, dust only changes the overall line
normalization and only weakly its shape, i.e. 
dust cannot change the line symmetry or induce a change in the number
of line peaks, moreover it does not change the line width by more than
$1\%$ ($5$ \kms\ in the case of \tol), an effect too small to be
observed at the resolution at which we have \tol's line profile and
also negligeable compared to the influence of the other free parameters in the model.
For these reasons we do not include any dust model. 

We use an analytical approximation that captures the most important
effects of rotation onto the \lya\ line. 
We defer the reader to \citet{GaravitoCamargo2014} for complete
details on the explicit form of this approximation.
To fully explore the
parameter space using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) calculation with the
\texttt{emcee} Python library \citep{2013PASP..125..306F}. \texttt{emcee} 
is an open source optimized implementation of the affine-invariant 
MCMC sampler \citep{goodman2010ensemble}. 
The algorithm creates a number of walkers that,
during a sufficient number of steps, generate parameters' combinations
for a specific model.
For each timestep, the code calculates the likelihood of the
combination with respect to the observational data.
The walkers explore the parameter space sampling the Gaussian likelihood
function built as $\propto \exp(-\chi^2/2)$, where the $\chi^2$ follows
the definition in Equation \ref{eq:chi2}. 
We do not have an analytic expresion for $\hat{f}$, we compute it
by numerical integration of the analytical approximations found in
\citet{GaravitoCamargo2014}.  

We explore flat priors on four parameters: $200<V_{\rm
  max}/\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1} <600$,   $6.0<\log_{10}\tau<9.0$,
$4.0<\log_{10} T/10^4\mathrm{K}< 4.5$ and $0<\theta<90$ using $500$
steps with $24$ walkers for a total of $12000$ points in the chain.
Previous exploratory work shows that it is impossible to fit the
observed line outside these priors.
Finally, we estimate the parameter values from the 16th, 50th and 84th
percentiles. 


\section{Results}


Figure 1. summarizes our main finding.
Dots represent the observational data for \tol\ with the
overplot from our best fits from the analytical solution for the
multiphase model (thick line)  and the rotating homogeneous gas sphere
(thin line). 

The fit to the observations is not perfect. 
However, in spite of the
simplicity of our models, this is the first time that the main
\tol\ features can be reproduced: a broad, highly symmetric,
single-peaked \lya\ line. 

This result does not demonstrate that the kinematic features we
include in our models are necessary to reproduce \tol's features, but
at least they show that they are a sufficient condition.
This is a significant step forward to understand the influence that
different kinematics have in producing the atypical line profile shown
by \tol.


In what follows we summarize the values of the kinematic parameters
that managed to explain \tol\'s \lya\ profile.


\subsection{Multiphase ISM}

With $14$ free parameters our first concern is discovering which are
the most relevant in reproducing \tol's line shape.
The results of the random forest classifier yield that the clump outflow velocity
$v_{\infty,\rm{cl}}$, the clump velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm cl}$ and the probability
that the \lya\ emission comes from the clumps $P_{\rm cl}$, are the
most influential parameters in finding a model with low
$\chi^2/d.o.f.$.

Figure \ref{fig:tree} shows as an illustration the results for a
classification tree.  
The tree starts with $28$ and $1962$ models in the low and high
$\chi^2/d.o.f.$ classes, respectively. 
We find that the best classification
yields $13$ and $44$ models in the low and high $\chi^2\d.o.f.$
classes, respectively, after selecting for $v_{\infty,{\rm cl}}<157.0$ \kms,
$\sigma_{{\rm cl}}>55.6$ \kms and $P_{\rm cl}>0.683$. 
The split in two classes is not perfect. 
This means that the 3 parameters in the
model are the most influential in finding models with low
$\chi^2/d.o.f.$, but that some combinations of the other 11 parameters
are also relevant to find a good fit.  

From the K-S tests we confirm that the same 3 parameters are the
only ones that can be constrained by observations;
$v_{\infty,\rm{cl}}$ (p-value  $10^{-18}$), $\sigma_{\rm cl}$ (p-value
$10^{-4}$) $P_{\rm cl}$ (p-value $10^{-4}$).
Once again, this test does not mean the other parameters do not
influence the resulting spectra at all; it means that they cannot be
constrained from \tol's observations. 


The best models are summarized in Figure \ref{multiphaseresults}.
Left column show the difference between the integrated distributions
of the full sample (2500 input models) and the models with the lowest
$\chi^2/d.o.f.$. 
The right column shows the actual $\chi^2/d.o.f.$ 
and its corresponding parameter value. 
Under these conditions we find $\sigma_{\rm cl}=$\sigmaclump,
$v_{\infty {\rm, cl}}=$\inftyclump\ and $P_{\rm cl}=$\probaclump. 

Qualitatively this result can be understood as follows. 
The broad \lya\ line is the result of subsequent \lya\ photon
scatterings due to (relatively) fast moving clumps while the
multi-phase nature (i.e., the existence of low-density inter-clump
regions where \lya\ photons can freely prograpagate)  ensures the high
flux at line center as observed.   
In turn, a lower velocity dispersion would produce a thiner line than
it is observed.
From the lower right panel in Figure \ref{multiphaseresults} we find that it
is unlikely that the clump velocity dispersion is lower than
$50$\kms. 
This is also supported by the classification tree example in Figure
\ref{fig:tree}.  

As a test, we also run a small set of 100 additional radiative
transfer simulations with random values for all parameters, except for
$\sigma_{\rm cl}$, $v_{\infty {\rm cl}}$, $P_{\rm cl}$ which are within the derived
constraints.
Consistent with the results from the random forest algorithm,
illustrated by the classification tree of Figure \ref{fig:tree}, we
find that $30$ models show $\chi^2/d.o.f.<35$.


Having constrained only 3 parameters, one migh wonder why the other 11
parameters do not seem to matter. 
However, this view is misleading. 
Even if for clumply models the line profile is most sensitive to only
a few parameters \citep{Gronke2016}, there are the rest of parameters
which affect the line profile at a level that cannot be neglected,
i.e. we cannot randomly pick 11 random, reasonable values for these
parameters, and expect to fit the line profile while only varying the
other 3, as the results for the classification tree example show in
Figure \ref{fig:tree}.



We cannot discard that another region of parameter space
could also work.
It might be interesting to explore in the
future with a higher sampling of the parameter space once new 
observations  clarify the kinematic nature of \tol \footnote{In
  Section \S \ref{sec:conclusions} we describe  in more detail what
  kind of observations could be performed in the near future to
  improve our understanding of \tol's kinematics.} . 
Considering the sparse sampling of parameter space and the results
from the random forest classifier, it is safer to consider that
the best values for $\sigma_{\rm cl}$, $v_{\infty {\rm cl}}$, $P_{\rm
  cl}$ are actually lower/upper/lower bounds, respectively. 


\subsection{Bulk Rotation}

The results for this model are easier to interpret due to the fewer
number of free parameters and its explicit influence on the
semi-analytic solution.
The results are summarized in  Figure \ref{emceeresults}. 
From this analysis we find that the best parameters in the rotation
model are a rotational velocity of  $V_{\rm max}=348^{+75}_{-48}$
\kms, a neutral Hydrogen optical depth of
$\log_{10}\tau=6.96^{+0.26}_{-0.18}$,  and an inter-stellar medium
temperature of $\log_{10} T/\mathrm {K} = 4.27^{+0.11}_{-0.18}$.   
We are also able to constrain the angle between the plane
perpendicular to the rotation axis and the observational line-of-sight
to $\theta = 35.78^{+2.13}_{-1.88}$ degrees.
This model cannot reproduce the slight asymmetry present in \tol's
\lya\ line; most probably this would require an small amount of
outflows, a feature that is not present in the model provided by
\cite{GaravitoCamargo2014}. 

The prefered value for the rotational velocity can be explained as
follows. 
Lower rotational velocities than the favored value would produce a
double peaked line as the different doppler shifts produced on
different regions of the rotating sphere would not be large enough to
smear the double peaks into a single peak
\citep{GaravitoCamargo2014}. 
For the same reason, higher rotation velocities could produce a single
peak but the line would be broader than it is observed.
The fact that the velocity and optical depth priors were wide enough,
allows us to suggest that the current values for the spherical model
found by the MCMC are robust given the observational constraints.




\section{Discussion}

\tol\ shows one of the most atypical \lya\ spectra observed so far.
Its flux at the line's center is high compared to other LAEs at low
redshift and the broad, highly symmetrical peak is virtually absent from other
LAEs at low and high redshift
\citep{2012ApJ...751...29Y,LARS,Erb14,Trainor16}. 
Simple shell models
fail to reproduce such a spectrum as reported by \cite{2015A&A...578A...7V}.  
In the previous sections we show how these characteristics can be
explained by two different kinematic models: multiphase ISM and solid
body rotation.

Which model has more
chances to be correct?  
We discard the rotation model by considering that the rotational
velocity of $\sim350$ \kms\ is too high for such a low
mass system. 
\tol's infered rotational velocity is larger than the
Milky Way's ($\sim200$\kms) while its baryonic mass is one order
of magnitude smaller. 
Furthermore, \tol's structural properties seem to be similar to known dwarf
elliptical galaxies. 
The sample of 7 dwarf ellipticals (dE) observed by
\cite{2003AJ....126.1794G} show similar properties as \tol. 
For instance, the dE galaxies IC 3344 and IC 794 have similar absolute $M_V$
magnitudes (-17.10 and -17.19) and sizes (0.90 kpc and 0.82 kpc) as
\tol. 
These dE galaxies have velocity dispersions of $31.1$ \kms and
$44.6$ \kms, respectively,  and their rotational velocities are lower
than $1$ \kms.  
This leads us to prefer the multiphase model as it provides 
a broad consistency with kinematic properties of dE galaxies.

 
Following the results of \cite{2011ApJ...726..108T}, who made a
detailed analysis for all kind of elliptical galaxies including, we
estimate a value for the dynamical mass using the constraints for
thevelocity dispersion $\sigma$  in a spherical system localized in a
region of size $r$   


\begin{equation}
M_{\rm dyn} = 3 \frac{\sigma ^{2}r}{G} = 3.48\times10^{9}
\left(\frac{\sigma}{100\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}}\right)^2\left(\frac{r}{\mathrm{kpc}}\right)
M_{\odot}, 
\end{equation}
%
Assuming that the \lya\ emission is entirely powered by star formation 
we use the 3D half-light radius $r_s=2.25$ kpc as the typical size
for the HI region, in the multiphase model the clump velocity dispersion
$\sigma_{\rm{cl}}=$\sigmaclump corresponds to a dynamical mass of
$M_{\rm dyn}=2.31\pm0.04 \times 10^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$, which is ten
times the estimated baryonic mass in \tol.
Considering that the results for $\sigma_{\rm{cl}}$ are most probably
a lower bound, the results for the dynamical mass should also be
considered as a lower bound. 

\cite{2011ApJ...726..108T} showed that  that such dynamical
mass can be explained if a dwarf galaxy is hosted by a dark matter halo of at
least $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ in mass. 
This estimate is based on computing the integrated mass profile of a
spherical dark matter halo with a Navarro-Frenk-White profile with its
concentration following the median mass-concentration
relationship found in the Bolshoi simulation
\citep{2012MNRAS.423.3018P}.  

These results would imply that \tol\ is part of the dE
class. 
However, there are two puzzles that are opened up by this hypothesis. 
First, dE galaxies are found either in clusters or groups of
galaxies; while \tol\ does not belong either to a group or a cluster
\citep{2001AJ....121..169F}. 
The second problem is that, unlike a dE, \tol\ hosts a bright and compact
startburst; imaging and spectroscopy studies suggest that the
startburst started less than 4 Myr ago, while the low surface
brightness regins are consistent with an age below one Gyr
\citep{2001AJ....121..169F}.

We suggest that new observational tests are needed to clarify the
kinematic nature of \tol\ and be sure about \tol's kinematic
structure. 
Integral field unit measurements resolving its spatial extent are up
to the task.  
\tol\ spans a region of $4$ arcseconds,
an instrument such as the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE)
\citep{2014Msngr.157...13B} with its nominal $0.2$ arcseconds spatial
sampling over a $1.0$ arcminute field in wide-field mode could provide
a coarse mapping of different ionization lines to infer a kinematic
map in the H$\alpha$ line, following the kind of work presented by
\citet{Herenz16} done with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrometer
(PMAS) \citep{PMAS} on nearby \lya\ emitting galaxies. 

Another observational test to confirm the picture provided by the
multiphase model includes the measurement of the \lya\ ionizing
continuum escape fraction. 
This model model predicts that averaging over all sightlines
it should be around $0.5^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$\%, with the possibility of strong
variations depending on viewing angle, i.e. some sightlines can have
an escape fraction close to $100\%$, \citep{Gronke2016}. 



\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we presented two kinematic models that independently
reproduce the so far unexplained observational features of \tol's
\lya\ emission line.  
One model is based on a multiphase ISM with random clump motions and
the other on gas bulk solid body rotation. 
It is the first time that an observed \lya\ profile can be fully
reproduced by either of these two kinematic conditions.
Our findings highlight the importance of including multiphase and/or
rotation conditions as kinematic features to model the \lya\ line.

We prefer the multiphase model becasue it has kinematic
conditions similar to those in dwarf ellipticals, while the
rotational model produces rotational velocities to high for a dwarf
galaxy.  

However, \tol's environment and star forming activity are radically
different from those of dwarf ellipticals.
We suggest that additional integral field unit observations are the
only way to be certain about the detailed kinematic structure in \tol.

All in all, the mere existence of a strong LAE galaxy with a broad,
highly symmetric line is interesting. 
\tol's line shape is different to others and seems to reveal an
unexpected kinematic structure.
A definitive confirmation of our findings has to be provided by new
observational tests with integral field unit spectroscopy. 
A confirmation of our results would support the multiphase model
as a tool to study the evolutionary link between star-forming and
quiescent stages of dwarf galaxy evolution.
