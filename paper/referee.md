We thank the referee for a detailed set of comments that allowed us to
greatly improve the quality of the paper. 

In this new version the most important change is in the discussion of
our results (which remain unchanged). We now discard the possible
influence of a supermassive black hole and favor instead a picture
where Tololo1244-277 has similar structural characteristics as
observed dwarf ellipticals. 

This opens up instead the puzzle as to why an isolated star-forming
compact dwarf galaxy could have similar structura characteristics as a
quiescent red dwarf galaxy found only in galaxy clusters. This
potential evolutionary link still depends on observational
confirmation of the velocity dispersion in Tololo124-277.

A new test using random forets classifiers (as a new Appendix) allowed
us to improve our discussion about the limitations of our method. 
We have also included an explicit plot on the integrated  mass profile
for dark matter halos consistent with Tololo's constraints. 

We have also included the smaller modifications suggested by the referee.

Below is the detailed reply to all the major comments.

With best regards, 

The Authors.

==========
 
1) The introduction lacks a stronger physical motivation for using the
Ly-alpha line as a probe of the physical conditions inside galaxies
and, in particular, the existence of a supermassive black hole. There
are other (Balmer, forbidden) lines accessible for nearby galaxies
that can provide the same or more information on the interstellar
medium and its kinematics from optical, ground-based observations, for
example. What does it make of the Ly-alpha emission a more adequate
probe - if that is the case - for this nearby galaxy? For
high-redshift (e.g. z>2.5) galaxies this is the only line available in
the optical, but for z~0 there are several other features. This
subject should be expanded and discussed more. The introduction starts
with a good motivation for the study of dwarf star-forming galaxies
but quickly moves on to the properties of the Ly-alpha emission
without developing the connection between this particular feature and
the physics of dwarf galaxies, particularly at z~0 as the target of
the this work is.
Or is it just the atypical line profile that matters? Why is this
Ly-alpha profile considered atypical? Why a symmetrical line profile
should not be expected? It would be good to have some explanation
about this too.

Reply. In this paper is the atypical Lya line what matters to
us. The highlight of this paper is the existence of models that are
able to reproduce the main feature of this line. A feat achieved for
the first time since the first Tololo1214-277 Lya observations in 1997.
We have modified parts of the Abstract, Introduction and Conclusions
to highlight this perspective.

2) It is not clear what the physical motivation for using the models
selected for the work and described in the text is. Why these models
in particular and not others? The authors refer to shell models
failing to reproduce the Ly-alpha line profile, but are there any
others apart from them and the ones used in this work that may be
useful?  The paper would benefit from a physically-driven
justification for the use of the bulk rotation and multiphase models
in particular.  For example, the Ly-alpha line profile that is the
central piece of the study has an unusual shape, not commonly seen in
Ly-alpha emitters. It would be good to provide an explanation on how
this fact drives the selection of the models in question. I encourage
the authors to expand more on this matter.

Reply. We have included a paragraph in the Introduction highlighting the
physical motivation for these two models. 

3) Have the authors checked dynamical masses for compact dwarf
galaxies in general reported in the literature? How do those values
compare with the dynamical mass estimate in this manuscript? How much
larger, typically, are compact dwarf galaxies with respect to
ultra-compact dwarfs?



Reply. We have looked carefully into published observational data for
compact dwarf galaxies (UCD's) and dwarf ellipticals (DE's). 
This helped us to realize that Tololo is closer to the sizes and
luminosities of dwarf ellipticals than UCDs'. 
The velocity dispersions observed in DE match the results of our
multiphase model.  
Furthermore, the dynamical modelling that has been already performed
on DE's allows us to put improve our constrains on the dark matter
halo mass required to match the kinematics, discarding the need for a
supermassive black hole.
It is still puzzling that: A) DE's are found in groups and clusters,
while tololo is isolated and B) DE's are not star forming, while
tololo hosts a starburst.
For this reason we have completely restructure the discussion section
to present this comparison. We have removed the consideration of the
black hole hypothesis.

My main concern with the final result (and the corresponding
interpretation) of this paper is that the dynamical masses may have
been overestimated somehow. Recently, Oyarzun et al. (2016) have
pointed out to the existence of a correlation between Ly-alpha
equivalent widths and stellar masses in the sense that lower stellar
mass galaxies have higher Ly-alpha equivalent widths. Is it possible
that this effect, if not corrected for, may be causing to measure
higher velocity values from the Ly-alpha profile that also result into
higher dynamical masses?

Reply. The high velocity come from the high line-width. Not from its
Equivalent Width (i.e. intensity to continuum ratio). The effects of
Oyarzun et al. 2016 should not change our conclusions.

In Fig. 1, none of the models seems to fit accurately enough the data
within the errors and within the full wavelength extent of the
Ly-alpha feature. For example, the multiphase model does not fit well
the positive high-velocity wing of the line profile, whereas the other
model does not fit the negative velocity side of the profile and part
of the positive velocity side. How much does this impact the kinematic
estimates? Is it possible that other models may do a better job? Can
these fits be improved, for example by considering a dust correction
to the data?  Authors should comment more on the limitations of the
fits shown in the figure.


Reply. The fit to the observations is not perfect.  However, in spite of the
simplicity of our models, this is the first time that the main
features can be reproduced: a broad, highly symmetric, single-peaked Lya line. 
We now highlight that our results do not demonstrate that the
kinematic features we include in our models are necessary to reproduce
Tololo's features, but at least they show that they are a sufficient condition.
This is a significant step forward to understand the influence that
different kinematics have in producing the atypical line profile shown
by Tololo.


B- SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

1) It would be good to have more information on the target such as its
redshift (in addition to the quoted velocity) and size (how does the
size compare with that of the Milky Way?); is it a field galaxy or is
associated with a known overdensity (group, cluster)? Is the galaxy
undergoing some kind of interaction? In this respect, showing a figure
with the image of the galaxy would be useful to understand its
morphology. This can be an optical image, for example (or other bands
if available). All this information will help to better understand the
properties of the galaxy that give context to the Ly-alpha emission.

Somewhat related to this, the velocity value quoted at the beginning
of section 2 is a bit different from that given in Table 1.

Moreover, it would be useful to have more technical information on the
UV observations themselves. Where do the Ly-alpha data come from?
What is the spectral resolution of the data? In addition to citing
Thuan & Izotov, explicitly providing this information in the paper
will make this one more self-contained. This may be helpful for
readers who like to have all the more relevant information "handy".

Reply. We have inlcuded a reference to the paper that presented the
detailed imaging results for Tololo. We have also included more
details on the intrumentation characteristics behind all the
observations we report.

2) The introduction of the idealized multiphase model (first sentence
of Sec. 3.1) needs a reference. This model uses clumps with random
velocities and also an outflowing velocity component. It is not clear
why an inflowing component is not considered. What is the physical
motivation for this? For example, naively speaking, mass inflows could
also affect the Ly-alpha line profile. There could be some information
that I missed. Therefore, it would be good to explain this more
clearly.

Regarding this model, it would be good to explicitly identify the
parameters being used and what they represent. Fourteen parameters
seems a large number. This may result in a fit without a clear or
realistic physical meaning as mathematically there is much freedom to
adjust the parameters. A fit with a smaller number of parameters may
give a more physically meaningful result. The authors should comment
on this, as this could affect the kinematic estimates and the derived
dynamical mass.

In fact, the authors show that only three of those 14 parameters seem
to be significant. What does it happen if the fit is now performed
with only those 3 parameters while keeping the rest fixed? What is the
impact on the kinematics and the dynamical mass in this case? Is there
any change/improvement with a fewer number of parameters? The authors
should test and comment on this.

Reply. In section 4.1 we have expanded our discussion on the
multiphase model. We have performed additional tests using random
forest classifiers to confirm that there are three parameters that are
the most influential. We have also expanded the discussion on why this
can be expected in our case. We hope that the new test help to clarify
the situation. 


3) In equation (1), what is the specific form of the model being
utilized? How are the different parameters in the multiphase and bulk
rotation models related to each other? It is desirable to have some
more explicit, mathematical description of the models and provide
analytical expressions if they exist.

Reply.  We don't have analytic approximations that can be directly
written down in a closed form. For the rotation we have an analytic
equations that must be numerically integrated. For the multi-phase
model the full MC simulation has to be performed. We now explain this in
the text.

4) On page 6, at the end of Sec. 4.2, it is said that "Lower
rotational velocities are disfavored by the fact that the line is
single peaked". What is the physical meaning of a single-peaked
Ly-alpha line? Wouldn't it be possible to explain such single-peak
line by a combination of processes different from just a high
rotational velocity? I believe that this conclusion needs some
stronger justification, and it would be good if the authors could
expand on it. Later, the text says "A lower rotational velocity would
produce a double peaked line". What is the physical explanation for
this? This may actually be not the only process by which a double-peak
line is produced. For example, there could be more than one
kinematical component in the interstellar medium producing such a
feature.  This needs to be better justified/explained.

Reply. We have included a comment on the physical intution that explains
the results for the rotation model (Based on our previous published
results in Garavito-Camargo et al 2014). We also explain that our approach is not designed
to reject the existence of different models that reproduce the
observed features in Tololo-1214, but insted focuses on the existence
of two physically motivated models that are suceessful in providing a
solution for the first time in the literature.
