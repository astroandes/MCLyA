1) The introduction lacks a stronger physical motivation for using the
Ly-alpha line as a probe of the physical conditions inside galaxies
and, in particular, the existence of a supermassive black hole. There
are other (Balmer, forbidden) lines accessible for nearby galaxies
that can provide the same or more information on the interstellar
medium and its kinematics from optical, ground-based observations, for
example. What does it make of the Ly-alpha emission a more adequate
probe - if that is the case - for this nearby galaxy? For
high-redshift (e.g. z>2.5) galaxies this is the only line available in
the optical, but for z~0 there are several other features. This
subject should be expanded and discussed more. The introduction starts
with a good motivation for the study of dwarf star-forming galaxies
but quickly moves on to the properties of the Ly-alpha emission
without developing the connection between this particular feature and
the physics of dwarf galaxies, particularly at z~0 as the target of
the this work is.

Or is it just the atypical line profile that matters? Why is this
Ly-alpha profile considered atypical? Why a symmetrical line profile
should not be expected? It would be good to have some explanation
about this too.

2) It is not clear what the physical motivation for using the models
selected for the work and described in the text is. Why these models
in particular and not others? The authors refer to shell models
failing to reproduce the Ly-alpha line profile, but are there any
others apart from them and the ones used in this work that may be
useful?  The paper would benefit from a physically-driven
justification for the use of the bulk rotation and multiphase models
in particular.  For example, the Ly-alpha line profile that is the
central piece of the study has an unusual shape, not commonly seen in
Ly-alpha emitters. It would be good to provide an explanation on how
this fact drives the selection of the models in question. I encourage
the authors to expand more on this matter.

3) Have the authors checked dynamical masses for compact dwarf
galaxies in general reported in the literature? How do those values
compare with the dynamical mass estimate in this manuscript? How much
larger, typically, are compact dwarf galaxies with respect to
ultra-compact dwarfs?

For example, ultra-compact dwarf galaxies are reported to have
dynamical masses of the order of 10^7-10^8 M_sun (e.g. Evstigneeva et
al. 2007, Hilker et al. 2007, Ahn et al. 2017). Some ultra-compact
dwarf galaxies have supermassive black holes of the order of 10^6-10^7
M_sun (Seth et al. 2014, Ahn et al. 2017). Our own Milky Way has a
supermassive black hole of M~10^6 M_sun (e.g. Ghez et al. 2008).

The supermassive black hole mass suggested here based on the dynamical
mass estimates is of the order of 10^9 M_sun. This seems somewhat
large for a compact dwarf galaxy considering that the supermassive
black hole in M87 is of the order of 10^9 M_sun (e.g. Macchetto et
al. 1997, Walsh et al. 2013). M87 mass within 32 kpc is of the order
of 10^12 M_sun (Wu & Tremaine 2006) and its stellar velocity
dispersion at ~1 kpc of the order of 300-400 km/s (Murphy et
al. 2014), consistent with the M-sigma relation (Gultekin et
al. 2009). Where does the black hole mass value proposed in this work
fall in the M-sigma relation, considering a calculated velocity
dispersion of ~55 km/s (Sec. 4.1)?  Is it possible to have a compact
dwarf galaxy with a mass of the order of that of M87 (as proposed in
Sec. 5) and a central velocity dispersion of 55 km/s? This looks odd.

My main concern with the final result (and the corresponding
interpretation) of this paper is that the dynamical masses may have
been overestimated somehow. Recently, Oyarzun et al. (2016) have
pointed out to the existence of a correlation between Ly-alpha
equivalent widths and stellar masses in the sense that lower stellar
mass galaxies have higher Ly-alpha equivalent widths. Is it possible
that this effect, if not corrected for, may be causing to measure
higher velocity values from the Ly-alpha profile that also result into
higher dynamical masses?

In Fig. 1, none of the models seems to fit accurately enough the data
within the errors and within the full wavelength extent of the
Ly-alpha feature. For example, the multiphase model does not fit well
the positive high-velocity wing of the line profile, whereas the other
model does not fit the negative velocity side of the profile and part
of the positive velocity side. How much does this impact the kinematic
estimates? Is it possible that other models may do a better job? Can
these fits be improved, for example by considering a dust correction
to the data?  Authors should comment more on the limitations of the
fits shown in the figure.

Also, in Sec. 5 the authors "lean towards the lower dynamical mass
estimate from the multiphase model as it seems easier to reconcile
with" a total halo mass of 10^12 M_sun (like Milky Way's or M87's) or
a supermassive black hole of 10^9 M_sun. This gives the impression
that the preferred model is selected only based on plausible outcomes
without a clear physical motivation: we do not really know whether a
supermassive black hole should exist or the total halo mass of the
galaxy be of the order of that of the Milky Way.

The authors should look into the questions above more carefully as the
conclusion of a supermassive black hole of 10^9 M_sun may be a wrong
interpretation of the data. There might be a black hole, but likely of
a lower mass than that proposed. Dynamical mass estimated may also
need some correction. Is it possible to explain the data by means of
other physical processes, without needing a supermassive black hole or
an halo mass of 10^12 M_sun for a compact dwarf galaxy?

The author should at least provide a more complete/compelling
discussion on these issues.

B- SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

1) It would be good to have more information on the target such as its
redshift (in addition to the quoted velocity) and size (how does the
size compare with that of the Milky Way?); is it a field galaxy or is
associated with a known overdensity (group, cluster)? Is the galaxy
undergoing some kind of interaction? In this respect, showing a figure
with the image of the galaxy would be useful to understand its
morphology. This can be an optical image, for example (or other bands
if available). All this information will help to better understand the
properties of the galaxy that give context to the Ly-alpha emission.

Somewhat related to this, the velocity value quoted at the beginning
of section 2 is a bit different from that given in Table 1.

Moreover, it would be useful to have more technical information on the
UV observations themselves. Where do the Ly-alpha data come from?
What is the spectral resolution of the data? In addition to citing
Thuan & Izotov, explicitly providing this information in the paper
will make this one more self-contained. This may be helpful for
readers who like to have all the more relevant information "handy".

2) The introduction of the idealized multiphase model (first sentence
of Sec. 3.1) needs a reference. This model uses clumps with random
velocities and also an outflowing velocity component. It is not clear
why an inflowing component is not considered. What is the physical
motivation for this? For example, naively speaking, mass inflows could
also affect the Ly-alpha line profile. There could be some information
that I missed. Therefore, it would be good to explain this more
clearly.

Regarding this model, it would be good to explicitly identify the
parameters being used and what they represent. Fourteen parameters
seems a large number. This may result in a fit without a clear or
realistic physical meaning as mathematically there is much freedom to
adjust the parameters. A fit with a smaller number of parameters may
give a more physically meaningful result. The authors should comment
on this, as this could affect the kinematic estimates and the derived
dynamical mass.

In fact, the authors show that only three of those 14 parameters seem
to be significant. What does it happen if the fit is now performed
with only those 3 parameters while keeping the rest fixed? What is the
impact on the kinematics and the dynamical mass in this case? Is there
any change/improvement with a fewer number of parameters? The authors
should test and comment on this.

3) In equation (1), what is the specific form of the model being
utilized? How are the different parameters in the multiphase and bulk
rotation models related to each other? It is desirable to have some
more explicit, mathematical description of the models and provide
analytical expressions if they exist.

4) On page 6, at the end of Sec. 4.2, it is said that "Lower
rotational velocities are disfavored by the fact that the line is
single peaked". What is the physical meaning of a single-peaked
Ly-alpha line? Wouldn't it be possible to explain such single-peak
line by a combination of processes different from just a high
rotational velocity? I believe that this conclusion needs some
stronger justification, and it would be good if the authors could
expand on it. Later, the text says "A lower rotational velocity would
produce a double peaked line". What is the physical explanation for
this? This may actually be not the only process by which a double-peak
line is produced. For example, there could be more than one
kinematical component in the interstellar medium producing such a
feature.  This needs to be better justified/explained.

C- MINOR COMMENTS/DETAILS (in order of appearance):

16) Last paragraph of section 2: the integrated upper-limit flux
indicated, what wavelength was it measured at?

17) Page 2, right column, 3rd paragraph of Sec. 3.1: "have a a flux"
--> "have a flux".

18) Figure 1: I would suggest rewording the third sentence in the
caption as "The thick red and thin blue curves represent our best fit
to the data using the full radiative transfer simulation with a
rotation and multiphase model, respectively". Also, what is the main
point to take away from this figure? This should be summarized with
some few words in the caption.

19) Page 3, left column, 2nd paragraph: when the authors say "We note
that the chi^2 gap in those 25 models is", it is not clear what this
gap means or how it is defined. Is it just the distance between the
chi^2 value of a model to the minimum chi^2 value?

20) Page 3, right column, 1st paragraph: with respect to the bulk
rotation model and the fact that dust "only weakly" changes the shape
of the line, how weakly is this effect? Can this explain the poorer
fit of this model to the blue side of the Ly-alpha line shown in
Fig. 1? Since no dust model is considered, how does this impact the
kinematic results based on the line fitting? Can this be quantified?
20%? 10%? Less?

21) Page 3, right column, end of 1st paragraph: "and allows us a full
parameter space exploration" --> "and allow us to fully explore the
parameter space" or "and allows for a full parameter space
exploration".

22) Page 3, last paragraph of Sec. 3.2: what is theta and how is it
defined? This information is provided later in the text, but it's
better to give it here first.

23) Figure 2: in the figure's caption, it would be good to explicitly
state what these parameters are. Also, why are the chi^2 values
rescaled by 1000 and not by the number of degrees of freedom (one
order of magnitude less)?

24) Figure 3: the main point to take away from this figure should be
summarized in the caption. What does the gray scale represent?

25) Page 5, left column, 3rd paragraph: "subsequent scatterings off
(relatively) fast moving clumps" --> "subsequent scattering due to
(relatively) fast moving clumps". In the same sentence, when saying
"very wide spectrum", do the authors mean a "very broad/wide Ly-alpha
feature"? I am not sure what a "wide spectrum" means. Or is it wide
spectral coverage? This should be clarified. Also, when saying
"existence of low-density channels", it is not clear what those
low-density channels are. Please explain or reword. Later in the
paragraph: "right panel in 2 we find" --> "right panel in Figure 2 we
find".

26) Page 5, last sentence of section 4.1: it says "once new
observations clarify". It would be helpful to be more specific/explicit
on the kind of new observations the authors are considering.

27) Page 6, at the end of Sec. 4.2: the sentence "Fixing the optical
depth at a high value of 10^7 ensures that the line width is close to
its observed value" implies that tau has been imposed. How about
something like "The observed line width is better reproduced with a
high optical depth value of ~10^7". In fact, the tau value is obtained
from a Monte Carlo computation process rather than by being fixed.

28) Page 6, at the end of Sec. 4.2: "allow us to think that" -->
"allow us to suggest that".

29) In the 1st paragraph of Sec. 5: a reference to Yamada et
al. (2012), ApJ, 751, 29 may be added to Oestlin et al., Erb et al.,
and Trainor et al.

30) In Sec. 5, its 2nd paragraph, when the authors "assume" that the
Ly-alpha emission is entirely powered by star formation, this is in
fact supported by the lack of X-ray flux associated with the
galaxy. The authors could refer to this here.
