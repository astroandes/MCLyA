We thank the referee for a new set of detailed revisions.

In this new version the most important change is that we use Integral Field Unit observations of 
Compact Dwarf Galaxies to argue for the multiphase model as being
closer to the expectation from Tololo 1214-277. 
This makes unnecessary the comparison against dwarf ellipticals.

We have also included the smaller modifications suggested by the
referee.
All the relevant changes are highlighted in boldface.

Below is the detailed reply to all the major comments.

With best regards,

The Authors.


First of all, it is not clear what the authors understand by
structural characteristics. This has to be defined more precisely. For
example, the distribution of matter, baryonic and dark matter, and the
internal kinematics (velocity maps and velocity dispersion maps) of it
give a precise account of structure. Morphology can also give
significant information on structure. The concept of structure has to
do with the arrangement and the relations between parts or elements of
something. For instance, two object may have the same size, same
magnitude, but one has a disk with a bar and two arms, and the other
three arms with a bulge and no bar. Those two objects
have different structures, in my mind.

Reply. We now make the comparison against other compact dwarf galaxies. 

The morphology of Tololo 1244-277 (see Fig.1 in Fricke et al. 2001) is
not consistent with that of a dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxy (e.g. Geha
et al. 2003). dEs are quiescent objects, with a regular
morphology. Instead, the target of this work seems to have opposite
properties. The authors seems to make the "connection" with dEs only
because the multiphase model provides a broad consistency with global
(not structural) properties (such as overall velocity dispersion, size, magnitude) of dEs. Moreover, it looks odd to prefer one model over another just because of a consistency with some properties of a
different class of objects. The selection of a particular model should
be based on robust results or the comparison with observations of
other objects of the same class. It seems that the connection with dE
galaxies is being "forced" here.

Reply. For the reason mentioned above we dropped the comparison
against dwarf ellipticals.


3) I am a bit surprised to see that there is no discussion on why Tololo
1244-277 may not be a dwarf spiral (dS) galaxy, for example. Why has
this possibility been discarded? At least, it is not discussed at all. The visual/morphological properties of dSs are at least more consistent with those displayed by the subject of this work. See for example the discovery paper by Schombert et al. (1995). What are the typical masses/sizes of dSs and/or dwarf irregular galaxies?


Reply. We now make the comparison against other compact dwarf galaxies. 

4) Furthermore, the authors highlight the fact that dEs are only found in
galaxy clusters and not in the field. I would downplay this a little
by saying that dEs are *preferentially* (not "only") found in clusters
as they also exist in the field, although in a much lower number
(fraction; e.g. Binggeli et al. 1988).

Reply. We now make the comparison against other compact dwarf
galaxies, which have similar environmental characteristics.

5) The dynamical mass of ~2x10^9 M_sun, obtained from sigma_cl~54 km/s,
seems to be about one order of magnitude above that of other dEs, as
reported in, e.g., Forbes et al. (2011), but consistent with dynamical
mass estimates for dEs in Geha et al. (2003) as indicated in Forbes et
al. (2011). In general, I would say that the dynamical mass reported
in this work is roughly consistent with measurements of other
dEs. Nevertheless, the authors find a virial mass of the order of
6x10^11 M_sun for Tololo 1244-277, which is one order of magnitude
larger than the stellar mass estimated for the Milky Way galaxy in a
much larger volume (see comment [2] below). This virial mass is
estimated by using a NFW mass density profile. The authors provide no
explanation as to why this is the most suitable mass
distribution. This profile is usually utilized for dark matter halos,
but dwarf galaxies may not necessarily be dark matter-dominated
objects (e.g. Swaters et al. 2011). What happens if another profile is
used, one with a core, for example? How much the virial mass would
change by in that case? This should be certainly discussed by the
authors as the virial mass estimate obtained is used as an argument to
make the link with dEs. What are typical virial masses of dEs? What is
the virial (or r_200) radius of Tololo 1244-277? This information should be given.

Reply. We motivate the computation of the dark matter mass estimate by
the fact that the dynamical mass is one order of magnitude higher than
the baryonic mass. As we don't use this anymore to argue for the
multiphase model over the rotation model, we keep this estimate as an
upper limit of what can be expected. Detailed mass models to test other 
profiles or deciding whether the Tololo is dark matter dominated would
require the full rotation curve of the galaxy. We mention that in the text. We have also removed this
estimate from the abstract given the large associated with this
estimate. 

The authors also say that the correlation found in Oyarzun et al. (2016) should not change their conclusions because the equivalent width (i.e. intensity-to-continuum ratio) seems not to be related to the line width, which is what they actually measure. In fact, the line
width (LW) does determine the equivalent width (EW), together with the
intensity-to-continuum ratio (ICR). One can change the LW and ICR
while keeping the EW constant. However, if the ICR remains constant,
by changing only the LW, one does change the EW. While the ICR is more
sensitive to abundance, the LW is more sensitive to velocity. Have the
authors actually checked whether the Oyarzun et al. (2016) does make,
in fact, no difference to their conclusions?

In general, I encourage the authors to do a more extensive research on
the properties of dSs and provide more compelling evidence that would
tie a BCDG, such as Tololo 1214-277, with the class of dEs rather than
dSs, for example, in a more natural way. Another possibility is that
there is nothing unusual about the nature of Tololo 1214-277 as a
BCDG in itself. That is, no need to make the argument of a BCDG living in the field but with properties of galaxies that live in higher density environments.


ABSTRACT:

(1) "We argue that the multiphase model has more chances to be
correct". I would not use the sentence "has more chances". The correct
interpretation should not be based on chance but on objective, solid
evidence. I would suggest to rephrase as: "We argue that the
multiphase model provides a correct interpretation of the data", or
something like this.

Reply. This has been updated.

(2) "Tololo 1214-277 is hosted by a dark matter halo of ~6x10^11
M_sun". Why would the physical size of that halo be? Note that the
estimated stellar mass of the Milky Way galaxy, including its disk, is
~6x10^10 M_sun (Licquia & Newman 2015). Is it possible that the dark
matter halo of a BCDG with an effective radius < 3 kpc be more than the stellar mass of the Galaxy? This information should be provided and discussed.

Reply. We quote the radius in the body of the paper, but given the
uncertainties in the assumptions of this calculation we have removed
it from the abstract.

(3) "it would provide additional support to expect this condition to
be present in primordial LyÎ± emitting galaxies.". What is the
significance of expecting this condition in the context of the
formation of such primordial Ly-alpha emitting galaxies? I think that
the abstract should end with a conclusion along this line.

Reply. The main consquence is the constraining power on models of star
formation and feedback. This is now mentioned in the abstract.

INTRODUCTION:

(4) "The motivation for the rotation without outflows as presented in
(Garavito-Camargo et al. 2014, as presented in) is" ---> "The
motivation for the rotation without outflows as presented in
Garavito-Camargo et al. (2014) is"

(5) Table 1 should contain the size of the galaxy.

(6) It would be good to add at the end of the introduction the
cosmological parameters utilized throughout the text. No need to
mention them after in the text. This is standard nowadays.

OBSERVATIONS:

(7) "as mede" ---> "was made"

(8) "the Hubble Space Telescope, these observations have a spectral
resolution" ---> "the Hubble Space Telescope, with a spectral
resolution"

MULTIPHASE ISM:

(9) "We do not explore inflowing clumps given the slight line
asymmetry redwards to the line center". Why?? It could be material
that is closer to the observer that is flowing into the galaxy. The
movement would be seen with a redshift but the material would be in an inflow.

(10) "parameters within a observationally" ---> "parameters within an
observationally"

BULK ROTATION:

(11) "To fully explore the parameter space using a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) calculation with the emcee Python library (Foreman-Mackey
et al. 2013).". This sentence seems to be truncated. It needs to be
reworded.

MULTIPHASE ISM:

(12) In Figure 2, I would move the legend in the top-left corner of
the top-left panel to the bottom-right corner of it. This would make
all the curves in the plot clearly visible.

(13) When giving the best-fit values for sigma_cl, v_infty,cl and
P_cl, it would be good to also include the corresponding reduced-chi^2
values.

(14) Please define beta_cl.

(15) "Furthermore, the relatively low mean number of clumps per line
of sight, f_cl, ...". How low is it? How is this number calculated?
This should be indicated.

DISCUSSION:

(16) "Tololo 1214-277 presents one of the most atypical Ly-alpha
spectra observed so far.". How statistically significant is this
claim? What is the estimated probability of finding a galaxy with the
properties of Tololo 1214? It would be good to back this claim up with
an estimate.

(17) "Which model has more chances to be correct?" Do not use the word
"chances". Please reword the sentence. Otherwise, if "chances" refers
to a probability, this one should be quantified.

(18) "Tololo 1214-277 is hosted by a dark matter halo of at ~6x10^11
M_sun in virial mass." ---> "Tololo 1214-277 is hosted by a dark
matter halo with a viral mass of ~6x10^11 M_sun."

(19) "an instrument such as the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer
(MUSE)". Is MUSE really well suited for such observations? This may be
an overkill due to the excessively large FoV of MUSE compared to the
angular size of the galaxy (see Fricke et al. 2001). Perhaps other IFU
instruments such as GMOS, IMACS, GIRAFFE may be better suited to the
task (unless there are several interesting targets within a 1-arcmin FoV centered in Tololo 1214). The authors may comment on this possibility.

CONCLUSIONS:

(20) Make the necessary changes according to all the comments above.
